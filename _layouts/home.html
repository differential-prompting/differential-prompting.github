        Automated detection of software failures
  is an important but challenging software engineering task. It
  involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing tests
  that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle
  asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to study how
  far this outstanding challenge can be solved by recent advances
  in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However,
  our study reveals that ChatGPT has a relatively low success rate
  (28.8%) in finding correct failure-inducing test cases for buggy
  programs. A possible conjecture is that finding failure-inducing
  test cases requires analyzing the subtle differences (nuances)
  between the tokens for a program’s correct version and those
  for its buggy version. When these two versions have similar sets
  of tokens and attentions, ChatGPT is weak in distinguishing their
  differences.

  We find that ChatGPT can successfully generate failure-inducing test cases when it is guided to focus on the nuances. Our
  solution is inspired by an interesting observation that ChatGPT
  could infer the intended functionality of buggy code if it is similar
  to the correct version. Driven by the inspiration, we develop a
  novel technique, called <a href="https://differential-prompting.github.io/Differential-Prompting"><strong>Differential Prompting</strong></a>, to effectively find
  failure-inducing test cases with the help of the compilable code
  synthesized by the inferred intention. Prompts are constructed
  based on the nuances between the given version and the synthesized code. We evaluate Differential Prompting on <a href="https://github.com/jkoppel/QuixBugs"><strong>Quixbugs</strong></a>
  (a popular benchmark of buggy programs) and recent programs
  published at Codeforces (a popular programming contest portal,
  which is also an official benchmark of ChatGPT). We compare
  Differential Prompting with two baselines constructed using
  conventional ChatGPT prompting and PYNGUIN (the state-of-the-art unit test generation tool for Python programs). Our evaluation results show that for programs of Quixbugs, Differential
  Prompting can achieve a success rate of 75.0% in finding failure-inducing test cases, outperforming the best baseline by 2.6X. For
  programs of Codeforces, Differential Prompting’s success rate
  is 60.0%, outperforming the best baseline by 6.0X.
